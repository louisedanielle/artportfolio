                    <p>This painting is a structural psychedelic painting of a quotational piece. This work represents
                        graphics or visual displays related to the quote of enjoy every moment or inspired by
                        psychedelic experiences and hallucinations known to follow the ingestion of psychedelic
                        colors and filling. The light house visual represents the light a light house gives to those who
                        enjoys the moment from the top of the view. These are times when you are uncertain about the future, and hence, we need to live in the
                        present and not think about the future. Life is all about living and enjoying those small
                        moments. It's the small moments that make life more fulfilling.</p>

                    <h5>The Walls of UPHC <span> Sept 2023</span></h5>
                    <p>This Painting is something of a memorable experience of UPHC and what is more
                        memorable than the halls of UPHC itself that we passed through every day. This is a
                        representative of an experience with a little of contrast and depth put into making piece.
                        I made this painting to represent the feeling of walking down the halls of UPHC. The
                        crowded stairway during moving class and the packed halls during recess. This piece talks
                        about the feeling of closure when everything stops and it's just her standing down the
                        memorable halls of UPHC. I used depth of the walls to represent anxiety as she stood there
                        alone thinking about more than just the crowded space. The painting only oriented on one
                        main person because it told a convey story of how even on a crowded space, she will always
                        face her school days alone.</p>

                    <p>This artwork is known as sakura in Japanese, cherry blossoms are the flower of the genus
                        Prunus trees. They can symbolize the fleeting nature of life, fresh starts and even people
                        coming together in friendship. Hana means flower, and mi means view. During the
                        blossoming season, families and friends gather for hanami, where they eat and drink under
                        the blossoms.</p>

                    <p>The black-white duality, means any given circumstance necessitates
                        both sides. Moreover, rather than indifference, I'm advocating to pay
                        close attention to the actions we take, understand the potential art
                        that is made using digital technology. This art represents subjects in
                        varying shades of neutral gray, that includes no other colors. The
                        color white represents pure light, and black represents darkness, this
                        peice represent contrasting ideas and parts. This style of fine art is
                        related to digital fine art that focuses on emotion and the expression
                        of it through feeling.</p>
